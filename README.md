# newsStation
A website for displaying news/articles uploaded by the user.
This site is uses only a minor amount of content management system.
Things left to add in the project:
1. a user page where in the user can delete or edit the contents that they have uploaded previously.
2. a display page that increases the number of views on the watching article.
3. the number of categories are to remain a constant otherwise it could overflow the page.
4. a comment section for each article, using a seperate table for comments, this has not been started or even planned anywhere as of yet.
5. it would also be preferable if all the php's can be saved in a folder, (expect index page , this one is a nessecary compromise).

The progress of the project is about 20%. Also, please do not create any inline CSS, store all of them on the CSS folder.
Keep all possible JavaScripts/ jQuerys in the scripts folder, do not clutter the php page if possible.
